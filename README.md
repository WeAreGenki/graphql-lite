# GraphQL Lite Client

**NOTE: This is a work in progress and not yet ready for real use.**

üçÉ Lightweight GraphQL client which combines Rollup build-time parsing, transforming, and tree-shaking of queries, and run-time client-side network requests. The goal is to have the most lightweight and performant GraphQL client run-time.

## Quick start

Install:

```sh
yarn add graphql-lite graphql
```

Setup in `rollup.config.js`:

```ts
import { graphql } from 'graphql-lite';

export default {
  plugins: [graphql()],
};
```

Use:

```ts
import { parse, request } from 'graphql-lite';

// TODO: Add usage example
```

## Browser compatibility

TODO: Add note about this package using native `fetch` and how to add a polyfill for old browser and node compatibility.

```sh
yarn add isomorphic-unfetch
```

TODO: Add note that is very old browser support is required, you need to also polyfill `Promise`.
